2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.815 ns between inst_axi4s_buffer/input_accept_int_reg/C (clocked by aclk) and s_axis_input_tready (clocked by aclk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.216 ns between gen_inst_reorder[0].inst_reorder/send_output_reg/C (clocked by aclk) and m_axis_output_tvalid (clocked by aclk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.677 ns between gen_inst_reorder[0].inst_reorder/buffer_sreg_reg[0]/C (clocked by aclk) and m_axis_output_tdata[0] (clocked by aclk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
